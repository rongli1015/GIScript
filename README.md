**GIScript**

# Overview:

GIScript is an COPU Licensed Script Language and Engine, written in Python,  For GeoSpatial Use.  

For a long time, GIS is described as a tool for professionals, for map making, but we say no.  

GIScript is for everyone use with a childish syntax built on Python, however we use a cross-platform C++ lib to ensure the engine's enterpise performance.
